# Hapi Boilerplate
### *A Hapi boilerplate with Sequelize, Sequelize-CLI and node-config*

Cool features in this boilerplate:

- It's modular. Define your routes, plugins, models and controllers separately.
- Uses [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config). Define all your configuration properties hierarchically and according to your environment.
- Models/ORM through [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/) and [Sequelize-cli](https://github.com/sequelize/cli) with common configuration! Supports migrations. Read more about sequelize and Sequelize-cli.
